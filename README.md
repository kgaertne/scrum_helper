# Project
Scrum Helper is designed to make it easier to follow scrum methodology in groups. Organized by workspaces, users can create, join, and leave workspaces. Within each, sprints can be made with all of the necessary information to keep the team organized. Artifacts, Events, and Roles are all there to view for the duration of the sprint.
